GI-SVM is a sensitive method for predicting genomic islands based on unannotated sequence of a single genome.
The program is written in python 2.7.

The additional packages required include:
shogun (http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/)
scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

To install scikit-learn, the following command can be used:
pip install -U scikit-learn
conda install scikit-learn
The detailed guideline for installation can be found in http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

The detailed guideline for installing shogun can be found in http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/installation.html

Below is a sample command to run GI-SVM
mkdir ./output/NC_003198
/usr/bin/time /usr/bin/python ./scripts/GI_SVM.py -N 0.9 -t 1 -k 6 -d ./output/NC_003198 -c 5  ./genome/NC_003198.fna -a > ./output/NC_003198/svm_std_NC_003198_6_1_0.9 2>&1 > ./output/NC_003198/std_NC_003198_6_1_0.9
